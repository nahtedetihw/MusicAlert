# MusicAlert
## Apple Music queue/loved alerts like on iOS 16.4!

MusicAlert makes the "Playing Next", "Playing Later", "Loved", "Unloved", "Loved", "Add to Playlist", "Add to Library" smaller and show up on the bottom of the screen instead of taking up the whole screen. iOS 16.4 introduced this feature in stock, MusicAlert just ports it to older versions.
